BigBlueButton
=============
BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for on-line learning.  

We believe that every student with a web browser should have access to a high-quality on-line learning experience.  We intend to make that possible with BigBlueButton. 

BigBlueButton supports real-time sharing of slides (PDF and any document readable by LibreOffice), webcams, whiteboard, chat, voice over IP (using FreeSWITCH), and desktop.  It can record and playback all content shared in a session.  The use cases for BigBlueButton are

  * One-to-one on-line tutoring
  * Small group collaboration 
  * On-line classes (50 or less)
